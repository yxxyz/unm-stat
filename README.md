# UNM Stat

**UNM Stat** is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to interface with a multi-channel potentiostat using the **LMP91000** analog front-end, controlled by an **STM32F103C8T6** microcontroller and connected via the **HM10 BLE module**. This application enables real-time electrochemical measurements and multi-technique control over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

## ðŸ”§ System Requirements

Before using the application:

- Ensure **Bluetooth** and **Location** are enabled on your mobile device.
- Do **not interrupt** the measurement process once it has started.  
  If the system becomes unresponsive, **power cycle the potentiostat** (unplug and reconnect).
